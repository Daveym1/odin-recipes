            Pour the whisky and amaretto into a mixing glass or jug.
            Add a large handful of ice, then stir with a long-handled spoon
            until the outside of the glass feels very cold. Taste to check the dilution,
            then fill a tumbler or rocks glass with ice.
            
        </li>
       
        <li>
            Strain the cocktail into the ice-filled glass. Either drop in the strip of orange peel
            or, to make a twist, trim the ragged edges from the peel and twist into a spiral around
            a skewer. Hold for a moment, then release gently and drop into the glass.
